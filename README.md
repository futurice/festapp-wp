festapp-wp
==========

[festapp](http://futurice.github.io/festapp-server/) Windows Phone client

This client was developed entirely during a weekend long hackathon. The current state of the app is far from complete, and there are quiet a few places which should still be refactored and improved. It's a result of trying to balance between getting things done and teaching WP coding to attendants. A lot of the code was made to provide a good foundation to work on, however, it's not used consistently everywhere in the app.
